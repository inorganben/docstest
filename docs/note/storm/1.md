# Preliminaries

The Urysohn metrization theorem is a fundamental result in topology that provides a sufficient condition for a topological space to be metrizable. The theorem states that every second-countable, regular (T₃) topological space is metrizable[1][2]. This means that if a space satisfies these two conditions, there exists a metric that induces its topology.
The theorem is named after Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn, a Soviet mathematician who made significant contributions to topology, including the development of Urysohn's lemma and the Urysohn metrization theorem[3]. Urysohn's work laid the groundwork for understanding the metrizability of topological spaces, and his theorem remains a cornerstone in the study of metrization criteria.
The theorem can also be restated in terms of separability: a topological space is separable and metrizable if and only if it is regular, Hausdorff, and second-countable[2]. This formulation highlights the interplay between separability, regularity, and second-countability in determining metrizability. Additionally, the Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem extends Urysohn's result to non-separable spaces by introducing the concept of σ-locally finite bases[2].
The proof of Urysohn's metrization theorem relies on constructing a continuous, injective map from the given topological space into a metric space, typically a Hilbert cube or a product of intervals. This construction leverages Urysohn's lemma to ensure the existence of appropriate continuous functions that separate points and closed sets[1]. The theorem's significance lies in its ability to provide a clear and practical criterion for metrizability, which has applications in various areas of mathematics, including functional analysis and differential geometry[2].

# Statement of the Urysohn Metrization Theorem

The Urysohn metrization theorem is a fundamental result in topology that provides a sufficient condition for a topological space to be metrizable. The theorem states that every second-countable, regular (T₃) topological space is metrizable[1][2]. This means that if a space satisfies the conditions of being second-countable (having a countable base for its topology) and regular (being able to separate closed sets and points by disjoint open sets), then there exists a metric that induces its topology[1][2].
It is important to note that while second-countability, separability, and the countable chain condition (ccc-ness) are equivalent in metrizable spaces, the Urysohn metrization theorem specifically requires second-countability as a condition[1]. For example, the Sorgenfrey line is a space that is T₃ but not metrizable, illustrating the necessity of the second-countability condition[1].
The theorem can also be restated in terms of separability: a topological space is separable and metrizable if and only if it is regular, Hausdorff, and second-countable[2]. This formulation highlights the interplay between separability and metrizability in the context of regular, Hausdorff spaces. The Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem later extended these ideas to non-separable spaces by introducing the concept of σ-locally finite bases[2].
Historically, the form of the theorem presented here was proven by Tikhonov in 1926, while Urysohn's original work, published posthumously in 1925, established a slightly different version[2]. Nonetheless, the theorem remains a cornerstone in the study of metrization and topological spaces.

# Proof of the Urysohn Metrization Theorem

The Urysohn metrization theorem is a fundamental result in topology that provides a sufficient condition for a topological space to be metrizable. The theorem states that every second-countable, regular, Hausdorff (T₃) topological space is metrizable[2][1]. This means that such a space can be endowed with a metric that induces its topology. The proof of this theorem relies on constructing an embedding of the given space into a metrizable space, typically a Hilbert cube or a countable product of real lines.

## Preliminary Construction

The proof begins by leveraging the properties of the given space. Since the space is second-countable, it has a countable base of open sets. Regularity ensures that for any point and a closed set not containing it, there exist disjoint open sets separating them. The Hausdorff property guarantees that distinct points can be separated by open sets[2][1].
Using these properties, one can construct a countable family of continuous functions that separate points and closed sets. This construction is facilitated by Urysohn's lemma, which allows the creation of continuous functions that take specific values on closed sets[1].

## Embedding into a Metrizable Space

The next step involves embedding the space into a metrizable space. Let $ X $ be the given second-countable, regular, Hausdorff space. Using the countable family of continuous functions constructed earlier, one can define an embedding $ F: X \to [0,1]^\mathbb{N} $, where $ [0,1]^\mathbb{N} $ is the Hilbert cube or a countable product of the unit interval[1].
The embedding $ F $ is defined such that each coordinate corresponds to one of the continuous functions. The uniform topology on $ [0,1]^\mathbb{N} $ refines the product topology, ensuring that $ F $ is continuous. The injectivity of $ F $ follows from the fact that the functions separate points, and the openness of $ F $ is guaranteed by the construction[1].

## Verification of Metrizability

Finally, since $ [0,1]^\mathbb{N} $ is metrizable (being a countable product of metrizable spaces), and $ F $ is an embedding, the space $ X $ inherits the metrizability from $ [0,1]^\mathbb{N} $. This completes the proof that $ X $ is metrizable[2][1].
The Urysohn metrization theorem is a cornerstone in topology, providing a clear criterion for metrizability and demonstrating the interplay between separation axioms, countability conditions, and metric spaces.

# Applications of the Urysohn Metrization Theorem

The Urysohn Metrization Theorem has significant applications in topology and related fields, providing a foundational tool for understanding the metrizability of topological spaces. One of its primary applications is in the study of manifolds. The theorem guarantees that every second-countable manifold is metrizable, which is crucial for applying analytical techniques and tools from metric spaces to manifolds[2]. This result is particularly useful in differential geometry and mathematical physics, where manifolds often serve as the underlying spaces for modeling physical phenomena.
Another important application lies in the classification of topological spaces. The theorem provides a clear criterion for determining when a space is metrizable, which is essential for constructing and analyzing examples in topology. For instance, it helps in identifying spaces that can be embedded into familiar metric spaces like Euclidean spaces, facilitating the use of geometric intuition and methods[1].
The Urysohn Metrization Theorem also plays a role in functional analysis and measure theory. By ensuring that certain topological spaces are metrizable, it allows for the application of techniques from these fields, such as the use of continuous functions and integration, to a broader class of spaces[2]. This has implications for the study of function spaces and the development of theoretical frameworks in analysis.
Furthermore, the theorem has historical significance, as it was one of the first widely recognized metrization theorems and laid the groundwork for subsequent results, such as the Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem, which extends the criteria for metrizability to non-separable spaces[2]. This progression highlights the theorem's enduring influence on the development of topology and its applications across mathematics.

# Related Theorems and Concepts

The Urysohn metrization theorem is closely connected to several other fundamental results in topology, which either extend its applicability or provide alternative conditions for metrizability. One such result is the **Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem**, which generalizes Urysohn's theorem to non-separable spaces. It states that a topological space is metrizable if and only if it is regular, Hausdorff, and has a σ-locally finite base[2]. This theorem is particularly useful in cases where second countability cannot be assumed.
Another important concept related to Urysohn's theorem is **Urysohn's lemma**, which is often used in its proof. Urysohn's lemma provides a method for constructing continuous functions that separate disjoint closed sets in normal spaces, a key step in demonstrating the metrizability of second-countable T₃ spaces[1]. The lemma itself is a cornerstone in the study of normal spaces and has wide-ranging applications in topology and analysis.
Historically, the form of the Urysohn metrization theorem commonly cited today was actually proved by **Andrey Tikhonov** in 1926, building on Urysohn's earlier work. Urysohn's original contribution, published posthumously in 1925, established a slightly different version of the theorem[2]. This historical context highlights the collaborative nature of mathematical progress and the refinement of ideas over time.
Additionally, the theorem is often restated in terms of separability, stating that a topological space is separable and metrizable if and only if it is regular, Hausdorff, and second-countable[2]. This formulation emphasizes the interplay between separability, regularity, and metrizability, which are central themes in the study of topological spaces.

# Examples and Counterexamples

The Urysohn metrization theorem provides a clear criterion for determining when a topological space is metrizable, but its application relies on specific conditions, such as the space being second countable, regular, and Hausdorff. Several examples and counterexamples illustrate the theorem's scope and limitations.

## Examples of Metrizable Spaces

One of the most straightforward examples of a space satisfying the conditions of the Urysohn metrization theorem is the Euclidean space $ \mathbb{R}^n $. This space is second countable, regular, and Hausdorff, making it metrizable under the theorem[1][2]. Another example is any second-countable manifold, which is also metrizable due to its regularity and Hausdorff properties[2].

## Counterexamples: Non-Metrizable Spaces

The Sorgenfrey line, also known as the lower limit topology on $ \mathbb{R} $, serves as a notable counterexample. While it is Hausdorff and regular, it is not second countable, and thus it does not satisfy the conditions of the Urysohn metrization theorem. Consequently, the Sorgenfrey line is not metrizable[1]. Similarly, the long line, a topological space constructed by "pasting" uncountably many copies of the unit interval, is regular and Hausdorff but not second countable, making it non-metrizable[2].

## Extensions and Related Results

The Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem extends the Urysohn metrization theorem to non-separable spaces by replacing second countability with the condition of having a σ-locally finite base. This generalization allows for the metrization of a broader class of spaces, including those that are not second countable[2]. However, the Urysohn metrization theorem remains foundational, particularly for separable spaces, and continues to be a cornerstone in the study of metrizability in topology.
